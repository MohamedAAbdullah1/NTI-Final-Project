# 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains **16,829 network observations**.

### Original Features

| Feature                        | Description                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `Timestamp`                    | Measurement timestamp           |
| `Locality`                     | Geographic/locality information |
| `Latitude`                     | Geographic latitude             |
| `Longitude`                    | Geographic longitude            |
| `Signal Strength (dBm)`        | Measured signal strength        |
| `Signal Quality (%)`           | Signal quality percentage       |
| `Data Throughput (Mbps)`       | **Target variable**             |
| `Latency (ms)`                 | Network latency                 |
| `Network Type`                 | Network technology              |
| `BB60C Measurement (dBm)`      | Signal measurement              |
| `srsRAN Measurement (dBm)`     | Signal measurement              |
| `BladeRFxA9 Measurement (dBm)` | Signal measurement              |

---

# 🧹 Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing stage focused on improving data quality while avoiding unnecessary feature removal.

### Removed Features

#### `Signal Quality (%)`

The feature contained a constant value and therefore provided no useful information for the models.

#### Hardware Measurement Features

The following measurements were highly redundant:

```text
BB60C Measurement (dBm)
srsRAN Measurement (dBm)
BladeRFxA9 Measurement (dBm)
```

Their extremely high correlation indicated that they contained largely overlapping information.

#### `Timestamp`

The timestamp was removed because exploratory analysis did not reveal a sufficiently useful temporal pattern for the modeling objective.

---

## Feature Preparation

The final model inputs consisted of:

### Numerical Features

```text
Latitude
Longitude
Signal Strength (dBm)
Latency (ms)
```

### Categorical Features

```text
Locality
Network Type
```

### Target

```text
Data Throughput (Mbps)
```

The network labels were also standardized by merging:

```text
LTE → 4G
```

resulting in:

```text
4G
3G
5G
```

---

# 🔐 Leakage-Free Preprocessing

The project uses `Pipeline` and `ColumnTransformer` to ensure preprocessing is learned only from the training data.

```python
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ("num", StandardScaler(), numerical_features),
        ("cat", OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown="ignore"), categorical_features)
    ]
)
```

This provides two important advantages:

* Consistent preprocessing during training and prediction.
* Protection against data leakage from the test set.

---

# 🤖 Machine Learning Models

Five regression algorithms were implemented and evaluated.

| Model             | Main Idea                                           |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Linear Regression | Linear relationship between features and throughput |
| KNN Regressor     | Predicts using nearby observations                  |
| SVR               | Learns a flexible regression boundary               |
| Random Forest     | Ensemble of decision trees                          |
| XGBoost           | Gradient boosting with sequential tree optimization |

---

# 📈 Model Performance

The models were evaluated using:

* **MAE** — Mean Absolute Error
* **RMSE** — Root Mean Squared Error
* **R²** — Coefficient of Determination

### Final Test Results

| Rank | Model             |      MAE ↓ |      RMSE ↓ |       R² ↑ |
| ---: | ----------------- | ---------: | ----------: | ---------: |
| 🥇 1 | **XGBoost**       | **6.4581** |     13.3298 |     0.7359 |
| 🥈 2 | Random Forest     |     6.4640 |     13.3387 |     0.7355 |
| 🥉 3 | SVR               |     6.5950 |     13.3597 |     0.7347 |
|    4 | KNN               |     6.6088 |     13.4226 |     0.7322 |
|    5 | Linear Regression |     6.8287 | **13.3191** | **0.7363** |

### Model Comparison

```mermaid

    title "Model Comparison — MAE"
    x-axis ["XGBoost", "Random Forest", "SVR", "KNN", "Linear Regression"]
    y-axis "MAE" 0 --> 8
    bar [6.4581, 6.4640, 6.5950, 6.6088, 6.8287]
```

> Lower MAE indicates better average absolute prediction error.

---

# 🏆 Model Selection

**XGBoost** was selected as the primary model because it achieved the **lowest MAE** among the evaluated models.

However, model performance is not identical across all metrics.

* **XGBoost** achieved the lowest MAE.
* **Linear Regression** achieved slightly lower RMSE.
* **Linear Regression** also achieved slightly higher R².
* Overall model performance was relatively close.

Therefore, XGBoost was selected primarily according to the project's focus on minimizing average absolute prediction error.

---

# 📐 Evaluation Metrics

## MAE

Mean Absolute Error measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted values.

A lower MAE means predictions are closer to the actual throughput values on average.

---

## RMSE

RMSE gives higher importance to larger prediction errors.

A lower RMSE indicates fewer large prediction deviations.

---

## R²

R² measures how much of the variation in the target is explained by the model.

A value closer to `1` indicates stronger explanatory performance.

---

# 🧠 Model Evaluation

The dashboard provides detailed evaluation for each regression model, including:

* Actual vs Predicted values
* Residual analysis
* MAE
* RMSE
* R²
* Mean residual
* Residual standard deviation
* Maximum absolute residual

### Evaluation Concept

    E --> F

    F --> G["MAE / RMSE / R²"]
```

---

# 🧩 Network Performance Segmentation

In addition to supervised regression, **K-Means Clustering** was used to discover groups of network observations with similar performance characteristics.

Three clusters were identified.

| Cluster | Performance Level    | Signal Strength | Throughput |   Latency |
| ------: | -------------------- | --------------: | ---------: | --------: |
|       0 | Low Performance      |      -86.47 dBm |  2.12 Mbps | 153.21 ms |
|       1 | High Performance     |      -95.82 dBm | 62.98 Mbps |  29.61 ms |
|       2 | Moderate Performance |      -91.27 dBm |  7.56 Mbps |  77.90 ms |

### Performance Profiles

```mermaid

    B --> C["Low Performance"]
    B --> D["Moderate Performance"]
    B --> E["High Performance"]

    C --> F["Low Throughput<br/>High Latency"]
    D --> G["Intermediate Profile"]
    E --> H["High Throughput<br/>Low Latency"]
```

> Cluster labels represent observed profiles in the dataset. They should not be interpreted as direct causal relationships between individual features and network performance.

---

# 📊 Key Network Insight

The clustering analysis revealed clear differences in network performance profiles.

The most important distinction between the identified groups was the combination of:

```text
Throughput
Latency
Signal characteristics
```

The high-performance cluster showed substantially higher throughput and lower latency than the other groups.

# 🔬 Reproducing the Project

The notebooks are organized according to the Machine Learning workflow.

Recommended execution order:

```text
01_EDA
   ↓
02_Preprocessing
   ↓
03_Linear_Regression
   ↓
04_KNN
   ↓
05_SVR
   ↓
06_Random_Forest
   ↓
07_XGBoost
   ↓
08_KMeans
   ↓
09_Model_Comparison
```

The preprocessing notebook creates the shared train/test datasets used by the modeling notebooks.

---

# 🔒 Reproducibility

The project uses fixed random states where applicable:

```python
RANDOM_STATE = 42
```

This helps maintain consistent train/test splits and reproducible model behavior.

---

# 📦 Saved Models

Trained models are persisted using `joblib`.

```text
models/
├── linear_regression.joblib
├── knn.joblib
├── svr.joblib
├── random_forest.joblib
├── xgboost.joblib
└── kmeans.joblib
```

This allows the Streamlit application to load trained models directly without retraining them during every application startup.

---

# 💡 Key Takeaways

### 1. XGBoost achieved the lowest MAE

The XGBoost model achieved:

```text
MAE = 6.4581 Mbps
```

making it the primary model for the dashboard.

---

### 2. Tree-based models performed competitively

Random Forest and XGBoost produced very similar results, indicating that both ensemble approaches captured useful nonlinear patterns in the dataset.

---

### 3. Different metrics can produce different rankings

No single metric should be considered in isolation.

The models showed slightly different behavior across:

```text
MAE
RMSE
R²
```

Therefore, model selection was based primarily on the project's main objective rather than claiming one model was universally superior.

---

### 4. Network observations form distinct performance profiles

K-Means revealed three interpretable network performance groups:

```text
Low Performance
Moderate Performance
High Performance
```

These profiles provide an additional analytical perspective beyond throughput prediction.

---

# ⚠️ Limitations

Although the project demonstrates a complete ML workflow, several limitations remain.

### Dataset Limitations

The model is dependent on the available network measurements and their quality.

### Generalization

Performance on unseen environments, locations, or network infrastructures may differ from the reported test-set results.

### Feature Availability

The prediction system only uses features available in the project dataset.

### Regression Error

The models still produce non-zero prediction errors, meaning throughput predictions should be treated as estimates rather than exact measurements.

### Clustering Interpretation

K-Means clusters describe patterns in the observed data but do not establish causal relationships.

---

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

* Collecting larger and more geographically diverse datasets.
* Adding additional network-quality indicators.
* Performing more advanced feature engineering.
* Testing additional boosting algorithms.
* Applying cross-validation more extensively.
* Adding explainable AI techniques such as SHAP.
* Adding geospatial network-performance maps.
* Monitoring prediction drift over time.
* Deploying the application to a cloud platform.
* Building an API layer for external applications.
* Adding real-time network measurements.

---
